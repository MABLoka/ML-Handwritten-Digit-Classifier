This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a large collection of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to classify digits from the MNIST dataset using machine learning techniques, specifically SVM, to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

Key Features:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the MNIST dataset for training by normalizing pixel values and splitting the data into training and test sets.
- Multiclass SVM: Implemented a multiclass SVM model for digit classification, leveraging the power of SVM for efficient classification.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other evaluation metrics to ensure reliable digit recognition.
- Optimized Performance: Tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and reduce overfitting.

This project demonstrates the application of Machine Learning to solve real-world problems and showcases the power of SVM in image classification tasks.
